        <h2 style="background-color: lightblue; font-size: 30px; border: 2px solid green;">Meta Descriptions and Keywords</h2>
        <p>Many search engines display the Meta description as part of the results page. If a Meta description is not provided, many search engines typically display the first 
            50-70 words of a document. Unfortunately, the header of a document might only contain information about the author and hence it would less likely be viewed. By providing
             a Meta description, a search engine will more likely display a summary of the document rather than simply the first few sentences.

        <p style = "color: green; font-size: 22px;">Most search engines rank the information in the title of a document higher than the information found in the body of a document. Hence, it is important that a descriptive 
            title be provided for each document. For example, if this document were placed on the Web, either one of the following titles below would describe this document. However, 
            the longer title not only tells the user exactly what to expect when this document is viewed, but since it contains more keywords, it would also more likely be retrieved and then viewed.
